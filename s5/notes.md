ToDo:

- timeline w/ images
  - edit: add images => DONE
  - delete single images => DONE
  - update image comment => DONE
  - image UI => DONE
  - read EXIF data
- accessibility menu buttons => DONE
- title for individual sites
- tags
- privacy policy
- nerd stuff
- import entries / insert content

==> publish <==

- syntax highlighting
- edit: markdown preview
- lazy loading
- login shouldn't be a route, just a JSON endpoint,
  or it should use form enhancement properly -> this may not work,
  because we're not actually on the login page

Questions:

- How to extend a typedef parameter in JSDOC?

Bugs:

- scrollbar in chromium look weird
- notes 404 when logged out
- error when no entries in timeline and navigate somewhere else

- login with blank credentials goes to blank page => FIXED, use 401 page for now
